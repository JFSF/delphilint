## Contributing

DelphiLint is open for contributions, from bug reports to new features. GitHub issues and pull requests are the core
locations for community involvement - check them out!

### Reporting bugs

Bugs can be reported on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/issues).
When reporting a bug, please do the following:
* Check that your issue has not already been reported
* Include the versions of SonarDelphi (and SonarQube, if applicable) you are using
* Be as specific as possible in your description
* If applicable, supply a minimal case that replicates the issue

### Requesting features

Feature requests can be listed on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/issues).
Note that this does not necessarily mean a developer will decide to implement the feature - if you would like a feature
consider implementing it yourself and [making a pull request](#making-pull-requests).

When requesting a feature, please do the following:
* Check that a similar feature has not already been requested
* Be as specific as possible in your description

### Making pull requests

[Pull requests](https://github.com/integrated-application-development/delphilint/pulls) are welcome!
When making a pull request, please do the following:
* Ensure that the functionality is widely useful rather than specific to your use case
* For new features, ensure that it has been discussed in an issue prior to making the pull request
* Describe the contents of your pull request
* Clearly explain the rationale for adding it to DelphiLint
